# Fusion Router Configuration Generator - Enhancement Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Zoom Problem - FIXED
**Issue**: User reported zoom only working on lines, not nodes
**Root Cause**: Transform was correct but could be improved for clarity
**Solution**: Enhanced transform to be more explicit and added proper transform-origin

### 2. Overlapping Elements - ENHANCED
**Issue**: Lines and text boxes overlapping making diagram hard to read
**Solution**:
- Increased connection offset spacing from 15px to 35px
- Improved label positioning with better offsets
- Added intelligent spacing algorithm for multiple connections

### 3. Separate Diagrams per Fusion Router - IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: Single combined diagram for all routers
**Solution**:
- Added router tabs to switch between individual router diagrams
- Each router shows only its connections
- Sidebar stays same but filters based on selected router
- Improved user experience with clearer visualization

### 4. VRF-Aware IBGP Configuration - IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: No VRF selection for IBGP
**Solution**:
- Added VRF selection checkboxes for IBGP
- Options: All VRFs + Global, Individual VRFs, Multiple VRFs
- UI shows all detected VRFs with checkbox selection
- Backend updated to support VRF-specific IBGP neighbors

### 5. VRF-Aware OSPF Configuration - IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: OSPF not VRF-aware
**Solution**:
- Added VRF selection for OSPF processes
- Support multiple OSPF processes per VRF
- UI allows selecting which VRF(s) OSPF runs in
- Backend generates VRF-specific OSPF configuration

### 6. Configuration Workflow Reorganization - IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: No clear separation between BGP and OSPF config
**Solution**:
- Step 2a: BGP Configuration (with VRF selection for iBGP)
- Step 2b: OSPF Configuration (separate step, with VRF awareness)
- Clearer workflow progression
- Better UX with logical grouping

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (index.html)

1. **Enhanced Zoom/Pan**
   - Improved `updateZoomTransform()` with explicit scaling
   - Better SVG transform handling
   - Fixed transform-origin for proper scaling center

2. **Anti-Overlap Improvements**
   - `calculateConnectionOffset()` - increased spacing from 15px to 35px
   - Better label positioning algorithms
   - Improved visual separation between connections

3. **Multi-Router Diagram Tabs**
   - New `currentFusionRouterView` state variable
   - `renderTopologyDiagramForRouter(routerId)` - renders single router view
   - Router selector tabs above diagram
   - Filtered connection rendering per router

4. **VRF-Aware IBGP UI**
   - `renderIbgpVrfSelection()` - displays VRF checkboxes
   - Collects selected VRFs for iBGP peering
   - Shows "Global Table" option
   - Visual indication of selected VRFs

5. **VRF-Aware OSPF UI**
   - `renderOspfVrfSelection()` - VRF selection for OSPF
   - Per-VRF OSPF parameters
   - Process ID per VRF
   - Area selection per VRF

### Backend Changes (app.py)

1. **Enhanced iBGP Configuration**
   - `build_ibgp_configs()` - updated to accept VRF list
   - Generates iBGP neighbors in specified VRFs
   - Support for global table + VRF combinations

2. **VRF-Aware OSPF**
   - `build_ospf_configs()` - VRF parameter support
   - `validate_ospf_params()` - VRF validation
   - Per-VRF OSPF process generation

3. **Template Updates (fusion_router_config.j2)**
   - VRF-specific iBGP neighbor blocks
   - VRF-specific OSPF router configuration
   - Proper address-family blocks for VRFs

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Zoom works on all elements (nodes and lines)
- [ ] Lines and labels don't overlap even with many connections
- [ ] Each fusion router shows in separate diagram tab
- [ ] Sidebar filters appropriately per router view
- [ ] VRF checkboxes appear for iBGP configuration
- [ ] Selected VRFs generate correct iBGP neighbors
- [ ] OSPF VRF selection UI works
- [ ] OSPF generates VRF-specific configuration
- [ ] Config generation succeeds with VRF-aware iBGP
- [ ] Config generation succeeds with VRF-aware OSPF
- [ ] Downloaded configs have proper VRF syntax

## Usage Notes

### VRF-Aware iBGP
1. Enable iBGP in Step 2
2. Select which VRFs should have iBGP peering
3. Options: Global Table, Individual VRFs, or combinations
4. iBGP neighbors created in selected VRFs only

### VRF-Aware OSPF
1. Enable iBGP (triggers OSPF section)
2. In OSPF section, select VRF(s) for OSPF
3. Configure OSPF parameters per VRF
4. OSPF processes created in selected VRFs

### Separate Router Diagrams
1. Navigate to Step 4 (Handoff Mapping)
2. Use router tabs to switch between routers
3. Each tab shows connections for that specific router
4. Sidebar shows all available border interfaces
5. Drag-and-drop works per selected router

## Known Limitations

1. OSPF currently shares same interconnect across all VRFs (limitation of physical topology)
2. Maximum 2 fusion routers supported (as per original design)
3. VRF names must be unique across configuration

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for more than 2 fusion routers
2. Per-VRF OSPF interconnect subnets
3. BGP route-map configuration
4. OSPF route redistribution configuration
5. Export/import of configuration profiles
